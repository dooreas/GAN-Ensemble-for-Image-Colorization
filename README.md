# GAN-Ensemble-for-Image-Colorization
This repository was created for our final project in Machine Learning Practical a course on Deep Learning given in my MSc in AI. 
The folders in this repository have each a readme file explaining what the code does. The project is on Image Colorization with Generative Adversarial Networks (in this case Pix2Pix). 
Our proposal was a two-stage model which had an initial ResNet34 model to classify grayscale images into certain categories which afterwards were coloured by a generator (among many)
that was specifically trained to color images in such categories. In the pdf file attached we also mention whose was the original code from which we built our proposal.
